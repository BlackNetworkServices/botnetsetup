<h1>IRC Botnet Setup</h1>
<h2>How to set up:</h2>
<p>First give permission to setup.sh "sudo chmod +x setup.sh"</p>
<p>Then run setup.sh with root permissions "sudo ./setup.sh", if root permissions aren't given, the script <b>will not</b> run.</p>
<p>After you go through the setup script, then you can now run the scan. The heavyaidra.py file has been configred.</p>
<p>Setup.sh was already given proper permission during the setup. So do "./setup.sh" to run the scan.</p>
<p>WARNING: Currently you cannot quit the script, unless you manually restart the server, or ssh into it and using htop (apt-get install htop) and kill the process</p>
<p>For htop, there will be multiple heavyaidra.py process, but if you kill one of them, it will kill all of it.</p>
<p>Use the arrow keys to select one of the heavyaidra.py process, press f9, then press 9 to kill the process.</p>
<p>Connect to this IRC server and join the channel #kek </p>
<p>Then run the command "!* help"</p>
<p>This will list the avaiable commands and will show you the bots hitting the target later on.</p>
<p>To attack a target do "!* tatay <ip> <seconds>" we reccomend 10-100 seconds of attack.</p>
